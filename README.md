# Introduction
  This Toolbox based heavily on [BIQA_Toolbox](https://github.com/HuiZeng/BIQA_Toolbox). <br> 
  I add some files needed and provide the code for testing my own dataset.
## How to run the Code
  1. Create a new folder databases. Download an IQA dataset into databases and extract the files. The default dataset name is  'MyDataset'.  <br> 
  2. Add the 'MosTxtName.txt' (two cloums: mos and name) and set the trainingPropertion.
  3. `Run evaluating_mydataset.m `
